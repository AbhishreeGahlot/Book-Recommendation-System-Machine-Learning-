# 📚 Book Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This Book Recommendation System leverages the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to suggest books based on user preferences. The system analyzes user ratings and similarities between books to provide personalized recommendations.

## 🏗 Features
- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering** - Recommends books similar to a given book based on features.
- 👥 **Collaborative Filtering** - Suggests books based on user behavior and preferences.
- 📊 **Data Visualization** - Insightful visualizations of book trends and user preferences.
- 🚀 **Efficient Search & Recommendations** - Utilizes KNN to find the most relevant book recommendations.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - `pandas` - Data processing and manipulation
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning (KNN implementation)
  - `matplotlib & seaborn` - Data visualization
- **Dataset**: Book-Crossing Dataset or any publicly available book rating dataset.

## ⚙ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.8) and install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommendation-knn.git
cd book-recommendation-knn
```

### Run the Project
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🏁 How It Works
1. **Load Data**: Import book ratings, user information, and book details.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract useful features for book recommendations.
4. **KNN Model Implementation**: Find similar books based on user preferences.
5. **Recommendation Output**: Get top-N book recommendations.

## 🎨 Example Usage
```python
from knn_recommender import get_book_recommendations

book_title = "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
recommendations = get_book_recommendations(book_title, top_n=5)
print(recommendations)
```

## 📊 Sample Visualization
The system provides visual insights such as:
- Most popular books 📈
- User rating distributions 📊
- Book similarity heatmaps 🔥

## 🛠 Future Enhancements
- 🏆 Hybrid Recommendation System (Collaborative + Content-Based)
- 🔥 Deep Learning Integration (Neural Networks)
